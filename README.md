# frontend-nanodegree-feedreader

### What is this?

This a project for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree. My mission is to compelete the testing suites using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).



### How to run it?

All you need to do is:

1. Uncompress the zip file
2. Locate the *index.html* file
3. Right click and open it with your favorite browser.
   (Or you can just drag it to a running browser)



### Notice

1. All the things you need is in the compressed file. If the file was damaged or corrupted, you can find a copy on my Github.
2. I will add more features to this project after I learn more about JavaScript.
